## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge was fun. I enjoyed completing this challenge. For the first time, I used these pseudo-elements:

1. first-child
2. nth-child()
3. last-child

Well using these elements make my task much easier.

```css
.testimonials:first-child {
  margin-left: 0;
}

.testimonials:nth-child(2) {
  margin-top: 5rem;
}

.testimonials:last-child {
  margin-top: 7rem;
}
```
